The answer to the problem for assignment one is 233,168. The Python script that I used to solve this problem is titled "exercise_1.py" and it is located in this repository. 

**Brief Introduction**
I'm a second-year student in the Health Data Science program at UCSF. I took DataSci 223 winter quarter last school year and that was my first ever Python experience. I decided to take this course to further build on my foundation of Python and get a better grasp of working with the terminal. I'd like to be able to get some more hands-on experience with the basics of Python and navigating the terminal throughout this course.
